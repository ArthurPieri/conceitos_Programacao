# Interfaces

## What is

Creates a new type, describing the property names anda value types of an object

can be generic or specific (depends on the domain of your aplication)

We can use an Interface like a gatekeeper to some functions

- Create functions that accept arguments that are typed with interfaces
- Objects/classes can decide to 'implement' a given interface to work with a function

we can use a '?' to show that something is optional
